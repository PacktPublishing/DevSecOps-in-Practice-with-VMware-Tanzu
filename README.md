**Build, run, and manage secure multi-cloud apps at scale on Kubernetes with the Tanzu portfolio**

## What is this book about?
As Kubernetes (or K8s) becomes more prolific, managing large clusters at scale in a multi-cloud environment becomes more challenging – especially from a developer productivity and operational efficiency point of view. DevSecOps in Practice with VMware Tanzu addresses these challenges by automating the delivery of containerized workloads and controlling multi-cloud Kubernetes operations using Tanzu tools. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build apps to run as containers using predefined templates
* Generate secure container images from application source code
* Build secure open source backend services container images
* Deploy and manage a Kubernetes-based private container registry
* Manage a multi-cloud deployable Kubernetes platform
* Define a secure path to production for Kubernetes-based applications
* Streamline multi-cloud Kubernetes operations and observability
* Connect containerized apps securely using service mesh
